Assignment: Introduction to Software Engineering
Instructions:
Answer the following questions based on your understanding of software engineering concepts. Provide detailed explanations and examples where appropriate.

Questions:
Define Software Engineering:

It is a systematic application of engineering principle, methods and tools to development and maintainance of high quality software systems. It involves design, development, testing, deploymentand maintenance of software products

What is software engineering, and how does it differ from traditional programming?

It is a systematic application of engineering principle, methods and tools to development and maintainance of high quality software systems. It involves design, development, testing, deploymentand maintenance of software products.
Software engineering often follow a more iterative process where software is continuously refined and improved based on user feedback. Traditional engineering disciplines typically follow a more linear process, where designs are finalized before construction begins.
Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC):

Is the cost-effective and time-efficient process that development teams use to design and build high-quality software.

Agile vs. Waterfall Models:

Waterfall  is a sequential approach with distinct phase flowing downwards like a waterfall and Agile is an iterative and incremental approach focused on flexibility, collaboration and responding to change.


Compare and contrast the Agile and Waterfall models of software development. What are the key differences, and in what scenarios might each be preferred?

requirements engineering?

Is the process of eliciting stakeholder needs and desires and developing them into an agreed-upon set of detailed requirements that can serve as a basis for all subsequent development activities.

What is requirements engineering? Describe the process and its importance in the software development lifecycle.

    1.Requirement Engineering Tasks
    2. Inception
    3. Elicitation
    4. Elaboration
    5. Negotiation
    6. Specification
    7. Validation
    8. Requirement management.
Software Design Principles:

 Are concerned with providing means to handle the complexity of a design process effectively.

Explain the concept of modularity in software design. How does it improve maintainability and scalability of software systems?

Modularity specifies to the division of software into separate modules which are differently
named and addressed and are integrated later on in to obtain the completely functional
software. It is the only property that allows a program to be intellectually manageable.
Single large programs are difficult to understand and read due to a large number of
reference variables, control paths, global variables.
It greatly enhances scalability by breaking down the software into independent modules, you can more easily adapt, extend, or replace parts of the system without affecting others.

Testing in Software Engineering:

Is the process of checking the quality, functionality, and performance of a software product before launching.

Describe the different levels of software testing (unit testing, integration testing, system testing, acceptance testing). Why is testing crucial in software development?

Unit testing - Is a type of testing uses tests for a single component or a single unit in software testing and this kind of testing is performed by the developer.
Intergration testing - type of testing is performed by testers and integration testing finds the data flow from one module to other modules.
System testing - is allowing to check the systemâ€™s compliance as per the requirements and all the components of the software are tested as a whole to ensure that the overall product meets the requirements specified. It involves load, reliability, performance, and security testing.
Acceptance testing - It ranges from easily finding spelling mistakes and cosmetic errors to relatable bugs that could cause a major error in the application.

Version Control Systems:

Are software tools that help software teams manage changes to source code over time.

What are version control systems, and why are they important in software development? Give examples of popular version control systems and their features.

Are software tools that help software teams manage changes to source code over time.
It facilitates coordination, sharing, and collaboration across the entire software development team. It enables teams to work in distributed and asynchronous environments, manage changes and versions of code and artifacts, and resolve merge conflicts and related anomalies.
Examples include Git, a version control system, and GitHub, a repository hosting service.

Software Project Management:
Is a system of processes and practices designed to help accomplish software-related objectives.

Discuss the key role of project manager. What are some key responsibilities and challenges faced in managing software projects?

Software project managers serve as liaisons between the development team and the other stakeholders in a software project. They may be responsible for communicating project status, managing changes and requesting additional resources to help complete the project.
Some of the challenges faced in managing software projects are:
    Misalignment between goals and business objectives 
    Communication 
    Lack of accountability 
    Resource allocation 
    Scope creep
    Project management software
    Poor planning and unrealistic deadlines 
Software Maintenance:

Is the process of modifying and updating a software system after it has been delivered to the customer.

Define software maintenance and explain the different types of maintenance activities. Why is maintenance an essential part of the software lifecycle?

Is the process of modifying and updating a software system after it has been delivered to the customer.
Corrective maintenance - carried out following detection of an anomaly and aimed at restoring normal operating conditions - carried out at predetermined intervals or according to prescribed criteria, aimed at reducing the failure risk or performance degradation of the equipment. 
Preventive maintenance - carried out by integrating analysis, measurement and periodic test activities to standards.
Risk-based maintenance - based on the equipment performance monitoring and the control of the corrective actions taken as a risks.
Ethical Considerations in Software Engineering:

Privacy, accuracy, property, accessibility, and effects on quality of life
